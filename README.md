# D3-challenge

This assignment analyzes trends between poverty and healthcare using vensus data. In order to best understand the findings, I created interactive charts using d3.

Specifically, I used HTML, CSS, JS, and d3.js to create a scatter plot that displays information related to healthcare and poverty in each of the 50 states.
